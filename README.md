# Foundation Tetsing

In an effort to learn the Foundation 6 framework, the homepage for a site called "City yoga" was created. 
This site was mostly exploring laying out content and learning SASS, using it for variables sich as the primary colours of the sake organisation.
The colours are a mix of light pastal greens and blues to make a nice natural calming effect, also employed are large wide images of people enjoying yoga in a natural environment to calm the user.
The homepage includes prices and testomonies from 'clients' to help reassure the user

This is a small but chearful site which was a sucessful learning project to get my crips on Foundation 6.
